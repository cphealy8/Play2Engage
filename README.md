# Play2Engage
Play2Engage is a game developed to help scientists develop engagement activities based upon a defined decks of identity characteristics. The user defines  identity categories e.g. religion, field, sport, hobby and then specifies identity characteristics (cards) for each category e.g. religion: Hindu, Christian, Agnostic. Play2Engage then samples these decks and generates random identity sets. Scientists are encouraged to how to engage with a particular group based upon the randomly generated identity sets.

## Getting Started
Everything you need to run Play2Engage is contained in the zipped file that you downloaded. To run Play2Engage click and run Play2Engage. On windows, run Play2Engage.exe. On Mac, run Play2Engage.app.

An example deck (ExampleDeck.xlsx) is provided. A video tutorial is included to walk you through how to use Play2Engage and how to create new decks. 
### How to Play
Once Play2Engage is running click **Load Deck** to load the excel file that contains the deck you will be playing with. Play2Engage will automatically populate the categories field with the available categories in the deck. 

Next, click **Draw Hand**. Play2Engage will randomly sample each category for an identity characteristic and then list the random selection in the hand field. 

To keep a set of identity characteristics, click to select the characteristic you wish to keep in the hand field then click **Keep**. The characteristic you selected will be stored in the field under Keep. Multiple characteristics can be selected by clicking and dragging or by pressing CTRL+click (windows) or CMD+click (mac). 

For long term storage of sets of identity characteristics we recommend copying the characteristics stored in *Keep* by copying them to an external document e.g. .docx, .xlsx, *etc*...
### Defining a Deck
Decks must be defined as excel (.xlsx) files. The identities characteristics should be organized into columns where the header of the column defines the category for the characteristics in the column (See ExampleDeck.xlsx). 
#### Deck Example
The deck below has 11 cards and 3 categories (Field, Religion, and Sport)
| Field |  Religion| Sport |
|--|--|--|
| Biology |  Hindu|Football |
|Physics | Christian| Golf|
|Astronomy| Atheist| Bowling|
||Jewish||
||Agnostic||
